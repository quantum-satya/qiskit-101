# Qiskit 101 - Quantum Computing Notebooks

## About
This repository contains beginner-friendly Qiskit notebooks.  
It follows my self-learning journey in Quantum Computing from my village in Budaun, UP, India.

## Running a Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/quantum-satya/qiskit-101.git

2. Navigate to the folder:
cd qiskit-101

3. Activate the virtual environment:
source ../qiskit-env/bin/activate

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

5. Open the notebook you want to run from the `notebooks/` folder.

## Author's Note
These notebooks are part of my self-study in Quantum Computing following:
- IBM Qiskit tutorials
- MIT OCW Linear Algebra (18.06)
- Brilliant.org Quantum Courses

The goal is to **learn and teach Quantum Computing in the Feynman style**, making complex topics simple and accessible.
